# shelf-host
An attempt at selfhosting platform with integrated single sign on.

This year I wanted to participate in Level1techs' Devember challange so it is just in the pre-alpha-alpha(idea/inception phase).

The idea of this project is to have simple selfhosting platform for home or small-team use. Since my previous experiance with selfhosting with single sign-on has been a bit too complicated and unsuccessful I am having a go at it. The idea is to run various services running inside podman/docker containers and be accessable through an integrated single-sign-on solution. And have a somewhat simple management interface for user and service management.

I'm not set on the solution I'll use but most likely it might involve:
   + podman
   + ansible
   + authelia or somesort of sso solution


I have not not decided on how to do it so it is open to ideas.
